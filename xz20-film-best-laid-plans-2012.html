This is a long post, but I’ve been sitting in a hospital bed for a week and have several days still ahead of me—and I finally have the clarity of mind to share with you all my recent ordeal. I’ve ridden motorcycles since I was a little girl—my dad and brothers riding around on Honda Trail 90s and Trail 70s when we would camp. I would also ride with friends on old Honda and Kawasaki 125s, which at the time seemed HUGE! But we had a good time. Fast forward through much of my adult life. I stopp. Пармелия - трава из детства.

I was cleaning out my Google Drive when I found a doc with something special in it. I guess when TPAB dropped, I had seen a post giving detailed analysis of the album - track-by-track. I must have saved it, because I wanted to use it as a source for writing or something.

This started as a paragraph response to Ben's post this morning, but I've made the mistake of adding to it throughout the day. It isn't meant as any form of finger pointing and is only based on my experience as an NFS fan. If you disagree with any part of this post, please comment. For all I know, my views could be a negative for the community as well. I know this is a long post, but I felt there was a lot to bring up.

I drew in primary and high schools, I dabbled in electronic music production, I tried my hand at guitar, singing, I got into 3D animation, and later, filmmaking. I was a good kid, reasonable grades, parents were (I assume) proud of how I was progressing through life, fairly athletic.

Many thanks to the countless people who contributed to 10 months of fantastic discussions about one of the most iconic (and one of my favorite) film franchises of all time. This is just a little recap/debrief/wrap up article where I'd love to get everyone's thoughts on the series as a whole. Additionally, I've done some more ranking and list making because it's fun and, let's be honest, there just aren't enough lists in the world! So let's open the discussion I went through all the anime I've seen and the various years they aired in, and chose my 5 favorite anime from each year, as well as how I'd rate and rank them in their respective years. Just a few notes on my criteria for this list: - In order to qualify for a year, the show must have started airing in that year. Shows that carried over into the next year do not qualify for both years. - Since I can't very well recommend someone watch a second season of a show without having Part 1: My Wife Is Making Write About This ( Part 2: Road Trip Down A Dark Memory Lane Part 3: Arrival At Black Fog Mountain ( Part 4: Happy Endings Never Happen ( 19 Late Evening July 1st 2012.

It’s like bloggers and websites secretly received cheques from Disney to write articles about how the prequels weren’t as bad as everyone remembers. Maybe this resurgence was real? Maybe it was Disney stoking the fires to try to revalue a piece of this very expensive property it just purchased? Y’know, how are you gonna. 
This is an excellent read on the history of asian male representation in the media - from the origins of asian male stereotypes that have been created , on purpose ,by whites on purpose justified by racism - as well as the fear of asians as the yellow peril. It also discusses the origins and the reasons why asian women have become prominent in hollywood as playthings of white characters ; essentially asian men and women are both merely pawns used by white supremacy to destroy unification.
